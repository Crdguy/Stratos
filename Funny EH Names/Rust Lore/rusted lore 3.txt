Rusted Lore 3: WD40K Missiles
When the sruttian war came to a close the science division of the second WEC reich (wunderwoeffen) created a cheap interplanetary missile carrying WD40.000 warheads able to derust whole continents, they launched them through makeshift wormholes into enemy systems to sruttian planets to wipe out their populace. trillions of them have been made and hit billions of planets, including the holy resting place of the rust disciples which included a shrine which was made while the rust lord himself was looking. The war ended not long after that and both parties were never to be heard of again. https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/315194939149385729/684139844686840053/image0.png
