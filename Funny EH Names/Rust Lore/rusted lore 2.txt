Rusted Lore 2: The Scavengers and Jan Salo's Revenge

three million years ago the scavengers weren't scavengers. they were a fairly strong faction called the warriors of srut whom spoke their own language, their technology was unique it primarily used the strong mineral called rustbestos which is stronger than nano carbon plating and way lighter. they had special armor made out of that rustbestos paired with unknown materials, it consumed energy but it was very strong and light. the hull of the ship itself consisted of rustbestos too and most of them were mining vessels which were deployed from enormous cargo ships. somewhere in time the warriors of srut had an internal struggle which caused an extreme civil war which only a few survived. this event is now known as De nesrutt xeenalos (the de-rust cataclysm) and was caused by a group of sixty high ranking members including salos tee-jan he is a techno mage. this tee-jan is still known today and is one of the most wanted entities in the known universe due his crimes which happened before most factions existed, he is immortal and able to kill lifeforms and usurp their bodies. two years before the players arrival he worked at a free stars base which got destroyed after the swarm hive mind knew the true indentity of this human with the name Jan Salo she send a ancient wormship to decimate the base which it did but jan salo got away with his most prized posession: an orb that can translate sruttian
