Rusted Lore 4: On the Existance of Rustfungi

Rust fungi were the first life forms to spawn in this universe without rust lord's intervention they can mostly be found on asteroids but are virtually everywhere.
Complex yet primitive the rust fungi aren't actual fungi but have some features which are similar. most have a tough crust in which optical sensors sensors are located (sometimes those are on mobile stalks or their drones)
despite their name they are semi organic and some parts of a handful of species are edible and a great of source of iron and anti oxidants.
most species produce sporocarps and/or pods and reproduce via spores, pods have more functions than just reproduction and some species have multiple kinds of them.
some of the higher rust fungi are sapient to some extent but do not have a centralized neural network with exceptions to the members of the eshufungi phylum and some more recent species,
there are no known diseases rust fungi can suffer except for mutations and cancer, the latter being nigh impossible for them to get.
some species produce a lot of valuable oil which can be used for fuel and rust fungi farms were a common thing back in the sruttian empire.
most rust fungi have some kind of defense system like tentacles. harpoon like extensions, oxidizing/acidic gasses or goo and "drones" some species are canivorous and will use these offensively and smarter rustfungi can use mechanical weapons.
